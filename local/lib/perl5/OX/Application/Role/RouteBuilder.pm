=head1 DESCRIPTION

NOTE: unless you are building new framework bits, you probably want to use
L<OX::Application::Role::RouterConfig> instead, which provides some nicer
syntax for some common route builders.

This role provides a C<RouterConfig> service for your application container,
which should contain a description of all of the routes your application will
be handling. This description must be a hashref, where the keys are paths and
the values are hashrefs with C<class>, C<route_spec>, and C<params> keys.
C<class> determines which L<OX::RouteBuilder> class to use to parse this route,
C<route_spec> is a description of the route itself, and C<params> provides a
hashref of extra data (for instance, with
L<OX::Application::Role::Router::Path::Router>, C<params> holds the
L<Path::Router> defaults and validations).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 parse_route($path, $route)

This method takes a path and a route description as described above and returns
a new L<OX::RouteBuilder> instance which will handle creating the routes. By
default it creates an instance of C<< $route->{class} >>, passing in the
C<$path>, C<< $route->{route_spec} >>, and C<< $route->{params} >> as
arguments, but you can override this in your app to provide more features.

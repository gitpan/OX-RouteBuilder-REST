=head1 NAME

OX::Application::Role::Request - application role to allow the use of request and response objects

=head1 VERSION

version 0.13

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyApp;
  use Moose;
  extends 'OX::Application';
  with 'OX::Application::Role::Request';

  sub build_app {
      my $self = shift;
      return sub {
          my $env = shift;
          my $r = $self->new_request($env);
          return $self->handle_response(
              MyApp::Controller->new->do_action($r), $r
          );
      };
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role provides some helper methods for handling request and response
objects in your application.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 request_class

This method can be overridden to provide your own custom request class.
Defaults to OX::Request.

This request class is expected to provide a C<new_response> method, so
overriding the response class to use can be done by overriding this method in
your request class.

=head2 new_request($env)

Creates a new instance of the request class for the given PSGI environment.

=head2 handle_response($response, $request)

Takes a response provided by the application and turns it into a proper PSGI
response arrayref. The default implementation of this method handles bare
strings (turns them into a response with a code of 200 and a C<Content-Type>
header of C<text/html>) and anything which can be provided to the
C<new_response> method of the request object. C<$request> must be passed in
addition to the actual response that was received in order to be able to call
C<new_response>.

=head1 NAME

OX::Application::Role::Router - base role for applications with routers

=head1 VERSION

version 0.13

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an abstract role for creating applications based on a router. You
probably want to use L<OX::Application::Role::Router::Path::Router> instead,
unless you need to use a different router.

This role adds a C<Router> service to the application container, which can be
configured by the C<build_router> and C<router_dependencies> methods. It also
overrides C<build_app> to automatically build a L<PSGI> application from the
routes in the router.

This role also defines the C<ox.router> key in the PSGI environment, so that
the application code and middleware can easily access the router.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 router_class

Required method which should return the class name which the router object
itself will be an instance of.

=head2 app_from_router

Required method which should take a router instance and return a L<PSGI>
application coderef.

=head2 router

This method returns the router instance that is in use. It is equivalent to
C<< $app->resolve(service => 'Router') >>.

=head2 build_router($service)

This method is called by the C<Router> service to create a new router instance.
By default, it calls C<new> on the specified C<router_class>. It is passed the
C<Router> service object, so that you can access the resolved dependencies you
specify in C<router_dependencies>.

=head2 configure_router($router)

This method is called after a new router is instantiated, to allow you to add
routes to the router (or do whatever other configuration is necessary).

=head2 router_dependencies

This method returns a hashref of dependencies, as described in L<Bread::Board>.
The arrayref form of dependency specification is not currently supported. These
dependencies can be accessed in the C<build_router> method.
